### Needs

  - She’s taking a regression course in the fall that assumes students
    already have some familiarity with R.
  - She’s taking the workshop to start learning R, mainly data wrangling
    and data visualization.
  - She is also looking for resources so she can keep practicing on her
    own after the workshop.
